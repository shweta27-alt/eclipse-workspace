1) given denominations 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000
And value k find the least no of notes to make up the sum of k 

2) max sliding window k 
Eg 5, -2, 7, 3, -4
k=2
Now find the subarray of size k having max sum
Here 7, 3 is the subarray having max sum of 10
k=3
Then subarray of 5 -2 7 produces max sum of 10

2.00 am to 2.00 

2) extension of sliding window
Find all possible subarrays having sum = k
Subarray of any size
